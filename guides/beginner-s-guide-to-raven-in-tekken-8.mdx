## **Getting Started with Raven**

Here are some foundational tips and strategies to begin your journey with Raven:

### **Learn the Basics**

* **Familiarize Yourself with Key Moves**: Start by learning Raven's basic moves. Focus on understanding his quick strikes, basic combos, and how to enter and exit his unique stances.

* **Practice Movement**: Tekken's movement system is complex but crucial. Work on your backdashing, sidestepping, and wave dashing with Raven to improve your maneuverability.

### **Develop Your Game Plan**

* **Mix-up Your Attacks**: Use a variety of high, mid, and low attacks to keep your opponent guessing. Incorporate throws and low pokes to break their defense.

* **Understand Spacing**: Learn to maintain the optimal distance from your opponent. Raven excels at medium range, where he can use his speed and ranged attacks effectively.

* **Condition Your Opponent**: Start simple; use repetitive moves to condition your opponent to expect certain actions, then surprise them with something different.

### **Training Focus**

* **Master a Few Combos**: Don't overwhelm yourself. Learn a couple of simple combos first, then gradually add more to your repertoire.

* **Defensive Play**: Practice blocking and learn to recognize when it's your turn to attack. Defense is as important as offense in Tekken.

### **Common Beginner Mistakes**

* **Over-Reliance on Special Moves**: While tempting, don't rely too heavily on Raven's teleports and flashy moves. They can be predictable and punishable.

* **Ignoring Defense**: Don't focus solely on attacking. A good defense is key to finding opportunities to punish your opponent.

## **Conclusion**
