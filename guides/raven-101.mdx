# Raven 101

## **Introduction to Raven**

Raven, a ninja with a complex and versatile fighting style, excels at conditioning opponents, utilizing his unique set of moves to control the pace and flow of the match. This guide dives into strategies for building respect, understanding neutral play, and effectively using back turn (BT) stance to dominate your opponents.

## **Understanding Raven's Gameplay**

Raven's gameplay revolves around mental frames and conditioning rather than traditional frame traps. Despite having legitimate frame traps, Raven shines when players use his moves to mentally pressure opponents, forcing them to make mistakes.

### **Neutral Play and Space Control**

* **Not Always Taking Plus Frames**: After landing a hit, instead of immediately pressing the advantage, consider sidestepping, backdashing, or pausing. This unpredictability can cause opponents to hesitate or make mistakes.

* **Frame Trapping**: If opponents disrespect your plus frames by mashing, use quick moves to frame trap. Raven has several options, including:

  * **3 for mid frame traps**

  * **Down Back 2 (d/b+2) for lows**

  * **Throws for mix-ups**

### **Key Moves for Neutral and Punishment**

1. **Down Forward 1 (df1)**: Use for frame trapping with its +8 on hit advantage.

2. **Down Back 4 (d/b4)**: A slow but plus-on-hit low that can catch opponents off-guard.

3. **Crouch Dash (qcf)** moves to cover distance and apply pressure.

### **Building Respect in Neutral**

* Use a mix of lows and throws to open up defensive opponents.

* Frame trap aggressively if opponents press buttons after your plus frames.

* Adjust your strategy based on opponent behavior, focusing on quicker moves if they tend to mash.

## **Mastering Back Turn (BT) Stance**

Raven's BT stance is a critical element of his gameplay, offering a mix-up potential and pressure tools.

### **Entering and Utilizing BT Stance**

* **Down Back 2 (d/b+2)**: A primary tool for entering BT stance with plus frames, allowing for immediate pressure.

* **Manual Cancel**: Learn how to safely exit BT stance, as many of Raven's BT moves leave him at a disadvantage if blocked.

### **Gaining Respect in BT**

* Utilize BT moves that leave Raven safe on block to bait and punish opponent reactions.

* Use the BT parry (BT forward 1+2) to counter opponents' aggression, leading to damaging combos and psychological pressure.

* Mix up your options from BT stance, including quick jabs, mids, and the occasional retreat, to keep opponents guessing.

### **Practical Match Strategies**

1. **Conditioning with Lows**: Recognize when opponents are vulnerable to lows and increase their usage accordingly.

2. **Adapting to Opponent Behavior**: Change your approach based on how the opponent responds to your moves. If they block high, go low. If they're overly aggressive, use BT parry or frame traps.

3. **Movement and Spacing**: Utilize Raven's excellent movement to control the space and force mistakes.

## **Conclusion**

Mastering Raven requires understanding not just his moves, but the psychology of your opponent. By varying your approach, employing strategic frame traps, and effectively using BT stance, you can condition opponents to respect your game plan, leading to more controlled and successful matches. Remember, Raven's strength lies in his unpredictability and the mental pressure he applies, making him a formidable character in the hands of a patient and strategic player.
